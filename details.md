There will be a signpost directing you into the venue, opposite Whetstead farm. If driving, please follow the driveway to the bottom and find a place to park.

The closest train station is Paddock Wood (a 10 minute taxi to the venue), which has direct trains from both London Bridge and London Victoria stations.

### Program

There will be a short ceremony, followed by an afternoon garden party in the sun (hopefully!). Some snacks will be provided throughout the afternoon, but there is no official lunch so please arrive having had a substantial brunch.
The evening will involve a sit down meal, followed by dancing.
There is an open bar, so just bring yourselves!

### Dress Code

Smart-casual - please come in something that you feel comfortable in, and dress for the summer! Be aware that the venue is outdoors with some soft terrain (for the men think dress trousers, chinos and shirts, with jackets and ties being totally optional).


### Accommodation

We have organised a “glamping village” and would love you all to stay on site with us! Please see the Accommodation page for more details.
