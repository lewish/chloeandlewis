There will be a signpost directing you into the venue and balloons at the entrance, which is opposite Whetstead farm on the east side of the road. If driving please follow the track along the hedge to the end for parking.

The closest train station is Paddock Wood (a 10 minute taxi to the venue), which has direct trains from both London Bridge and London Victoria stations.

### Programme

The ceremony will be at 1.30pm and will be followed by an afternoon garden party. Finger food and drinks will be provided throughout the afternoon (but there is no lunch). In the early evening there will be a sit down meal, followed by music and dancing.
There is an open bar, so just bring yourselves!

### Dress Code

Smart-casual - please come in something that you feel comfortable in, and dress for the summer! Be aware that the venue is outdoors with some soft terrain. (For the men - think dress trousers/chinos and shirts, with jackets and ties being totally optional).


### Accommodation

We would love you to stay on site with us overnight and have organised a “glamping village”. Please see the Accommodation page for more details.
