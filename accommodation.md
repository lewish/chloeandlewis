We have organised a mini “glamping village” which you can book to stay on site overnight, and not have to worry about late night taxis. Breakfast will also be provided for anyone staying!

The bell tents come in various sizes, with a thick roll up beds and furniture including a small table, Indian rug, cushions and a throw.

The number of tents is slightly limited, so please book your tent as soon as possible via the following website: [http://www.boutiquecamping.com/lewis-and-chloes-wedding-i180](http://www.boutiquecamping.com/lewis-and-chloes-wedding-i180).

If you would like to share with more people than you know, let us know on the RSVP form and we will try to co-ordinate this.

There are also a selection of hotels within 10 mins taxi from the venue.
