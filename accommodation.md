We have organised for a mini “glamping village” so that guest can stay on site and not have to worry about late night taxis. Breakfast will also be provided for anyone staying with us!

The bell tents come in various sizes, with a thick roll up beds and furniture including a small table, Indian rug, cushions and a throw.

Options:

- 2 person tent (£192, or £92pp)
- 4 person tent (£192, or £48pp)
- 6 person tent (£238, or £40pp)

Full bedding can also be provided for £20pp, or if you would rather keep it cheap then bring along a sleeping bag.

Tents are slightly limited in numbers, so please book asap to avoid disappointment via the following website: TODO.

If you would like to share with more people than you know, let us know on the RSVP form and we will try and find you some mates.

There are also a selection of hotels within 10 mins taxi of the venue.
